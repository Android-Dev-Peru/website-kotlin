    <string name="conf_coc_discrimination_p1">Words like "crazy," "insane," "mongoloid," or "mentally retarded" are examples of ableist language that devalues people with physical or mental disabilities. Often, this does not stem from an intentional desire to offend, but from the normalization of what it means to be "normal." These words can be avoided by using more appropriate and clear descriptions of what you want to communicate. For more information about disability discrimination and replacement terms, please read this guide.</string>
