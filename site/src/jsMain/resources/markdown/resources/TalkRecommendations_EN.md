## TL;DR;

- **About your slides**:
  - Be concise. Avoid excess text and graphics.
  - Use a large font size. Very large.
  - Contrast colors. Light > Dark (for presentations)
  - Do not use screenshots of giant blocks of code, they are not visible.

- **About your IDE**:
  - Increase the font size.
  - Activate "Presentation mode" if possible.
  - Preferably, use **light** mode.

- **Ask us for feedback**. We will review your presentation and give you advice.

> [!TIP]
> In a face-to-face event, there will be people sitting several meters away and viewing the presentation from different angles. Therefore, it is important that the visual elements are clear and easy to read.

## Prepare your material
- Identify your goal: What do you want the audience to learn or do after your talk?
- Identify your audience: Who are they? What level of knowledge do they have?
- Create a draft of your talk: What topics are you going to cover? In what order?
- Use bullet points as a summary.
- For a technical talk:
  - Use a large font size. Very large.
  - _Serif_ fonts are for papers, not for presentations.
  - Use simple graphics and diagrams.
- Close your talk with a "call to action".

## Practice your presentation

- **Time your talk** taking into account the time assigned for your presentation.
- **Record yourself while rehearsing** (preferably). You can see your mistakes and correct them.
- **Prepare frequently asked questions**. Anticipate doubts.

> [!NOTE]
> Remember: the audience is on your side. They are in the room for you. To listen to you. They want you to do well.
